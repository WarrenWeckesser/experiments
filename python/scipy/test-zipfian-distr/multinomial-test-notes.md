Using the multinomial test for the Zipfian distribution
-------------------------------------------------------

Consider the concrete example a=1.25, n=3.  Using such a small n will allow
use to enumerate all the possible outcomes of the multinomial distribution
developed below.

```
In [34]: a = 1.25

In [35]: n = 3

In [36]: k = np.arange(1, n + 1)

In [37]: pmf = zipfian.pmf(k, a, n)

In [38]: pmf
Out[38]: array([0.59746908, 0.25120481, 0.15132611])
```
Some samples from this distribution:
```
In [45]: zipfian.rvs(a, n, size=15)
Out[45]: array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1])
```

Consider taking 10 samples and counting the occurrences of each value
from the support.  With numpy, we can use `np.bincount`:

```
In [68]: x = zipfian.rvs(a, n, size=10)

In [69]: b = np.bincount(x)

In [70]: b
Out[70]: array([0, 8, 1, 1])
```
0 is not in the support of the Zipfian distribution, so `b[0]` will always be 0.
Let's skip it, and put the rest in `y`:

```
In [71]: y = b[1:]

In [72]: y
Out[72]: array([8, 1, 1])
```

`y` is a sample from the multinomial distribution, implemented in SciPy
as `scipy.stats.multinomial`.

```
In [56]: from scipy.stats import multinomial

In [57]: multinom = multinomial(10, pmf)
```
So we can find the probability of `y`:

```
In [74]: multinom.pmf(y)
Out[74]: np.float64(0.055553039250723496)
```
In the *multinomial test* we add to that probablility the probabilities
of all other points in the support where the probability is less than or equal
to that probability to get the p-value of the test.

There are 66 points in the support of this multinomial distribution
The function `multinomial_support_generator()` was written to enumerate
all the points:

```
In [76]: supp = np.array(list(multinomial_support_generator(10, 3)))

In [77]: supp
Out[77]: 
array([[10,  0,  0],
       [ 9,  1,  0],
       [ 9,  0,  1],
       [ 8,  2,  0],
       [ 8,  1,  1],
       [ 8,  0,  2],
       [ 7,  3,  0],
       [ 7,  2,  1],

       [ 5,  5,  0],
       [ 5,  4,  1],

       [ 4,  5,  1],
       [ 4,  4,  2],
       [ 4,  3,  3],
       [ 4,  2,  4],
       [ 4,  1,  5],
       [ 4,  0,  6],
       [ 3,  7,  0],
       [ 3,  6,  1],
       [ 3,  5,  2],
       [ 3,  4,  3],
       [ 3,  3,  4],
       [ 3,  2,  5],
       [ 3,  1,  6],
       [ 3,  0,  7],
       [ 2,  8,  0],
       [ 2,  7,  1],
       [ 2,  6,  2],
       [ 2,  5,  3],
       [ 2,  4,  4],
       [ 2,  3,  5],
       [ 2,  2,  6],
       [ 2,  1,  7],
       [ 2,  0,  8],
       [ 1,  9,  0],
       [ 1,  8,  1],
       [ 1,  7,  2],
       [ 1,  6,  3],
       [ 1,  5,  4],
       [ 1,  4,  5],
       [ 1,  3,  6],
       [ 1,  2,  7],
       [ 1,  1,  8],
       [ 1,  0,  9],
       [ 0, 10,  0],
       [ 0,  9,  1],
       [ 0,  8,  2],
       [ 0,  7,  3],
       [ 0,  6,  4],
       [ 0,  5,  5],
       [ 0,  4,  6],
       [ 0,  3,  7],
       [ 0,  2,  8],
       [ 0,  1,  9],
       [ 0,  0, 10]])
```
We can use that to apply the mutinomial test to `y`.
First compute the probabilities for each point in `supp`:
```
In [78]: p = multinom.pmf(supp)
```
Then find all the values in `p` that are less than or equal to
`multinom.pmf(y)`, and add them up. That is the p-value for the
test.
```
In [80]: mask = p <= multinom.pmf(y)

In [81]: pvalue = p[mask].sum()

In [82]: pvalue
Out[82]: np.float64(0.5483587189939042)
```
So the p-value for this particular sample of 15 values from the
Zipfian distribution is approx. 0.548.

We can run the test again to generate another p-value:
```
In [94]: x = zipfian.rvs(a, n, size=10)

In [95]: y = np.bincount(x)[1:]

In [96]: y
Out[96]: array([5, 1, 4])

In [97]: mask = p <= multinom.pmf(y)

In [98]: pvalue = p[mask].sum()

In [99]: pvalue
Out[99]: np.float64(0.10317895737403479)
```

Consequences of discreteness
----------------------------

We can apply the multinomial test to many samples, and inspect
the set of p-values for any unexpected behavior.

It is important to note that, because this is a discrete distribution,
we cannot say that the p-value will be uniformly distributed on the
interval [0, 1].  That is generally true for hypothesis tests applied
to a continuous distribution, but it does not apply here.  In our
example, the support of the multinomial test has 66 elements.  This
means there are at most 66 possible p-values.  The highest possible
p-value is 1, which occurs when the element from the multinomial
distribution with the highest probability is selected.

```
In [102]: i = np.argmax(p)

In [103]: supp[i]
Out[103]: array([7, 2, 1])

In [105]: mask = p <= multinom.pmf([7, 2, 1])

In [106]: pvalue = p[mask].sum()

In [107]: pvalue
Out[107]: np.float64(1.0000000000000078)
```

With a bit more code (not shown here) we can compute all the possible
p-values for this trial. Here they are, sorted from highest to lowest
p-value:

Notice that at the top of the list (where the p-values are largest),
the spacing between the p-values is large.  A uniform distrbution for
the p-value would not be a good approximation to the actual discrete
distribution of p-values.
