Solve the 1-D Gray-Scott PDE with the Method of Lines
-----------------------------------------------------

The script `gray_scott_demo.py` uses the [method of lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_lines)
to solve the 1-D [Gray-Scott](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/amorphous/GrayScott/)
equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.

The script uses [`numpngw`](https://pypi.org/project/numpngw/) to generate this animated plot:
